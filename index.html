<p>datetime-lock is a little configurable security tool for ubuntu who can deny the physical access to your system according to the configuration of the programm. 
You are invited to write some start-up scripts for others distributions as ubuntu, 
because i think the programm have not to be adapt himself.</p>

<p>How does it work ?<br>
datetime-lock must be first configurated throught the different available<br>
command-line options, giving multiple ways to set:<br>
-A start date and a start time.<br>
-An end date and an end time.<br>
Or with the regular date settings to set as:<br>
-A or some specific days of week like:<br>
  -&gt; --today<br>
  -&gt; --weekend-days (saturday and sunday).<br>
  -&gt; --week-days (monday, thuesday, wednesday, thursday and friday.)<br>
  -&gt; --days (The selected days from the weekdays list.)<br>
During this time, slice your system is protected against some physical<br>
present offender with bad intentions, like cracking your password, even if<br>
he does not know it before the violation of your home, your workplace or<br>
where ever your system is located.                                           </p>

<p>After datetime-lock configuration the programm print a summary with the<br>
currently settings.<br>
!!! The programm does not ask for any confirmation: if you make an mistake<br>
    during the configuration, you will see it in the clear printed summary;<br>
    if you want to reset the settings do not block the system with an error<br>
    way you must call the --disable option who will reset the configuration<br>
    so that your system is not locked with datetime-lock.                    </p>

<pre><code>Anyway else the locking is now activated and your system is untouchable  
for the configurated time slice.                                         
</code></pre>

<p>The locking mechanism is an automatic directly shutdown process who will<br>
prevent from bad intentions intruder, to tip the password, even if he<br>
knows it, because the system will automatically shutdown by booting.         </p>

<p>In addition datetime-lock log system attemps which you can read with the<br>
--display-logs options.                                                      </p>
